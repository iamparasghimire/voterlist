# Voter List Scraper

This project is a starting point for scraping voter list data from [https://voterlist.election.gov.np/](https://voterlist.election.gov.np/).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Playwright

## Setup

1.  Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  Install Playwright browsers:
    ```bash
    playwright install
    ```

## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Notes

- The website uses dynamic dropdowns. The script currently opens the page. You will need to inspect the page elements (Right-click -> Inspect) to find the `id` or `name` attributes of the dropdowns (State, District, Municipality, etc.) and update `main.py` to select them programmatically.
- Scraping large amounts of data may take a long time and should be done responsibly.
